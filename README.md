Syriatel, a telecommunication company in Syria are worried of losing customers recently and it seems to get worse overtime.To try and fix this, the project aims to analyze customer data and create machine learning models to identify those at risk of churning,while keeping focus on the main goal of achieving accurate predictions.By understanding why customers leave, Syriatel can hopefully improve their services and improve on customer retention which in turn will attract new clients by effectively allocating resources based on the predictions. phase-3-project

DATA UNDERSTANDING 
Here will work with a customer churn dataset from the telecom industry in Syria, sourced from Kaggle website  and  It contains 3333 records and 21 columns.

Objectives
To find reasons behind customers churning, develop models to accurately predict the rate and give solution to churning

MODELLING
Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Desicion Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier

Reccomendations

Ways on how syriatel can reduce on churning rate:

They should focus on customer service calls  to improve retention

They should consider promoting international plans to customers with frequent international calls

They should potentially adjust pricing strategies to curb churning

On account length they should reward long term customers to enhance loyality
